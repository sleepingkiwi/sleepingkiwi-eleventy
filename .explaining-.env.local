# .env.local is a file that is used to provide Environment variables during local development.
# in production you'll use environment variables on your server.
# For Netlify: https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/environment-variables/
#
# .env.local is not included in version control so keys are not exposed
# it has the following format:

export SOME_KEY='your secret private API key'
export SOME_OTHER_KEY='your other secret private API key'
